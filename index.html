        <h3>Background & Objective</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have always had a strong passion for tech and a love to create and
          build things. My interest in the field of software development truly
          became apparent after I had written my very first program in the Java
          language, which was a simple tic tac toe game that ran on the
          terminal. It had a simplistic use case but it took me hours of
          researching, debugging, and learning to complete, and despite the
          challenges I enjoyed every moment of the development process, and
          became truly fascinated with the world of software engineering. <br><br> I have
          since acquired my associates degree of computer science from Houston
          Community College, and am now currently in progress of acquiring my
          bachelors degree in computer science from the University of Houston,
          with a  Senior Capstone in Software Engineering. My goal is to become
          a full-stack software developer, utilizing technologies such as React,
          Nodejs, Expressjs & MongoDB, most commonly refered to as the MERN tech
          stack.
